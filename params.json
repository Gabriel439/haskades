Back-end code is written using the high-level [Haskell](http://haskell.org) language.  The only C++ is autogenerated.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    ./haskades HaskadesBinding.hs haskades_run.cpp < Types.hs\r\n\r\nWhere `Types.hs` is a Haskell source file containing a record type declaration named `Slots` and a sum type declaration named `Signals` which fully specifies the communication possible between the UI and the backend.  QML code can access these signals and slots on the `app` context object.  Haskell code can emit signals by using the `emit` function exported from the generated HaskadesBinding.  The `emit` call is threadsafe.\r\n\r\n[Text and Lazy Text](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text), as well as standard `String` values all end up as `QString` in the QML, and vice-versa.  [UTCTime](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/time) becomes `QDateTime`. `Int`, `Double`, and `()` are passed through fairly directly.\r\n\r\n## Getting Haskades\r\n\r\nTo make effective use of Haskades, you will need to build a GHC cross-compiler.  [Get the source](http://haskad.es/ghc.tar.xz.torrent) and follow the instructions in README.BB10.  You will need an existing version of GHC or [the Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/) to build it.\r\n\r\nInstall the tool from Hackage:\r\n\r\n    $ cabal install haskades\r\n\r\nOr build it from source (requires [mustache2hs](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mustache2hs)):\r\n\r\n    $ make && make install\r\n\r\nThis platform is still early, so let us know how it works for you.\r\n\r\n* Please report issues on [Github](https://github.com/singpolyma/haskades/issues).\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n* [Simple starter app](https://github.com/singpolyma/haskades-sample)\r\n* [Template for a \"headlines\" app](https://github.com/singpolyma/haskades-headlines)","name":"Haskades"}
